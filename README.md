Github repo for Kicket, Cricket based kicking game. 
Jam submission, after voting period plan to expand on the game. Maybe add bowling/fielding, and different modes. 
Code needs some tidying up, was rushed certainly towards the end of the jam. Busy week and weekend didn't help! 
Known tiny bugs: Audio, can trigger 'out' audio multiple times. Need to add a check after the jam. 
First 'Come on Biggsy' audio only meant to trigger once at the start of the first over, as opposed to twice before, - oversight. 
Not a bug, but you can only 'kick' once, then you can move the bat but can't kick, was to stop double hits, but is a little messy and unclear.
