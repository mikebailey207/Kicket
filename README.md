Github repo for Kicket, Cricket based kicking game. 
Jam submission, after voting period plan to expand on the game. Maybe add bowling/fielding, and different modes. 
Code needs some tidying up, was rushed certainly towards the end of the jam. Busy week and weekend didn't help! 
Known tiny bugs: Audio, can trigger 'out' audio multiple times. Need to add a check after the jam.
